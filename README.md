# Bolt-Modelling-Tools

## Overview
This repository provides Python scripts for the material and geometric modeling of high-strength steel bolts. The codes are designed to facilitate the calibration of material properties and bolt behavior parameters, ensuring accurate numerical simulations.

## Prerequisites
Before using these scripts, please ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **Python Environment**: It is recommended to execute the scripts within the Anaconda package manager ([Anaconda Official Website](https://www.anaconda.com/)) for ease of dependency management and environment isolation.
2. **Optimization Library**: For material and bolt behavior parameter calibration, PyMO ([Pyomo Official Website](https://www.pyomo.org/)) must be installed.
3. **ABAQUS Compatibility**: The provided ABAQUS modeling scripts are written in Python 2, which aligns with ABAQUS versions up to 2024. As of ABAQUS 2025, the software has transitioned to Python 3, which may introduce compatibility issues. It is advisable to run these scripts within ABAQUS versions up to 2024 to avoid inconsistencies.

## Code Quality & Contributions
The scripts are structured with readability and efficiency in mind. However, potential errors or areas for improvement may exist. Contributions that enhance code efficiency, accuracy, and compatibility are highly appreciated.

For bug reports, feature requests, or contributions, please submit an issue or a pull request.
